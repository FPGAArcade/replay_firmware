FPGAArcade community conduct

Presented here are guidelines for a safe, respectful, productive, and
collaborative place for any person who is willing to contribute to the
project. We are committed to making participation a harassment-free experience
for everyone.

* When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always
    assume good intentions and be tolerant of opposing views.

* The use of sexualized language or imagery is not acceptable.

* Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal
    attacks and disparaging personal remarks. No Trolling.

* Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.

* Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic
    addresses, without explicit permission, is forbidden.

* Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate for the
    forum in which it occurs is unacceptable.

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these
principles to every aspect of managing this project. Those who do  not do so may
be permanently removed from the project team.

These guidelines apply both within project spaces and in public spaces when
an individual is representing the project or its community.  It should also be
noted that these standards also applies to all communication with the FPGAArcade
channels such as, but not limited to, email, Slack and the forums.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported by contacting a project maintainer or admin@fpgaarcade.com
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident.
