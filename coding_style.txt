braces always
    if (x is true) {
       bla
    }

except for functions
        int function(int x)
        {
                body of function
        }
indent standard is 2 spaces

variables all lower case with _
function names mixed case, starting upper case

Use 0 for integers, 0.0 for reals, NULL for pointers, and '\0' for chars.
